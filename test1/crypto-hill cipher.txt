Surprise! The technique you'll need for solving this one has not been covered in our sessions. By now, you should be able to look at the description of a basic cipher and be able to implement it, whether it's encryption or decryption.
•	Cipher-text: KZGT
•	Key: BBBBBCBCBBBABECD
Hint: You might have to deal with something related to "a landform that extends above the surrounding terrain".
Find out the corresponding plain-text!

solution=>
1. The hint suggests a landform that extends the surrounding terrain, which is a mountain, hill or delta.  On googling a cipher called hill cipher was found.
	So its a hill cipher!!!
2. It involves writing  the plain text and key in the form of matrices, filled with numbers corresponding the letters as A->0, B->1 .... Z->25.
   the number of characters in the plaintext should be perfect square and that of the key is the root of it.
3. The cipher text is calculated by multiplying the plaintext with the key and then mod 26.
   converting the letters back to letters, we get the ciphertext.
4. So plaintext x key = cipher
   so plaintext = cipher x key-1 
   following the steps, we get plain text as 'BLUE'.
   so the answer is BLUE
