The program asked to input a number, and two outputs were possible
1)Success
2)Nope_try again

Goal: To get success

0xa means 10.
A function calculates the factorial(10!),
this is divided by the number we enter and checked whether it is equal 0x15180 which in decimal is 86400.
So 10!/number = 86400 => number = 10!/86400
=> number = 42
So, 42 gives success!!
