This program asks us to give command line arguments (three of them)
The possible outputs are 
	1) Try harder
	2) You_have_found__an__answer._Find_the_logic_as_well
	3) Some numbers (explained below)

The takes three numbers through the commmand line and uses them as coefficients of a quadratic equation a,b,c in 
	1)if b^2 - 4*a*c ==0 , then output(2)
	2)if b^2 - 4*a*c > 0 , then output(3), which are the roots of the equation
	3)if b^2 - 4*a*c < 0 , then output(1)
