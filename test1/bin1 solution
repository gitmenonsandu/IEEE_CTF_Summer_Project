This program asks us to give command line arguments (three of them)
The possible outputs are 
1) Try harder
2) You_have_found__an__answer._Find_the_logic_as_well
3) Some numbers (explained below)

The program checks if the three numbers are the coefficients of a quaadratic equation with real integer roots
if They are coefficients of a quadratic equation with equal roots
	then output(2) is shown
else
	the roots are displayed

If the numbers are not as mentioned above, then try harder is displayed
